This paper brings new data and methods in order to expose the structure and the evolution of regional interdependencies. Although our focus is on the UK regions, the proposed research framework lends itself to applications to other European countries. Inter-regional trade relationships have traditionally been very difficult to capture, as national statistics do not monitor intra-country trade links at the firm level. Recently, the EUREGIO project (Thissen et al., 2018) has published spatially disaggregated Input-Output information for 37 NUTS2 UK regions at a 14 industries level, which includes imports and exports by region of origin and destination. Nevertheless, building such a regional I-O dataset has been a costly and non-trivial process. In this paper, we are proposing a research framework to predict such flows by utilising freely available web data. We are able to aggregate these data and create an inter-regional network based on the hyperlinks between geolocated commercial webpages. Formally, we approach the prediction of the I/O flows as a link prediction problem. Hence, we employ some well-established machine learning models, such as Random Forests, to predict the I/O flows using, among other features, the network of digital interdependencies between the UK regions.
