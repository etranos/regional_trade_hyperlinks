Dear Prof. Bian,

Thank you for offering the opportunity to revise and resubmit our paper. In this revised version of the manuscript, we have amended the analysis and text to address the very useful referee comments. We made sure to clarify and sharpen the key contribution of the paper. We do indeed use an estimator which is 'bread and butter' for data science, but we believe that our research framework is novel as we utilise openly available web data to make *out of sample predictions* instead of estimating a traditional, explanatory, parametric model. Importantly, these predictions are useful for both for researchers and policy makers as there are very limited data regarding regional trade flows and hardly any for more granular aerial units. 

The current version of the paper includes a new appendix submitted as 'online_appenidix.pdf' which contains tables to address some of the reviewer comments. If the paper is accepted we will also publish on a webiste a second online apendix with interactive visualisations of the hyperlink data and our disaggregated predictions and include the relevant URL in the 'online_appenidix.pdf'. We tried to include the relevant .html file in our submission, but unfortuantely the journal platform cannot effectvely deal with .html files and interactive visualisations.

We have also uploaded a detailed response to the reviewer comments.

Best,
Dr Emmanouil Tranos
